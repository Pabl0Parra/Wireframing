# Wireframing

### Level 1

From the wireframe that we provide you in png format, you will have to make the layout in <b>desktop format</b>. The chosen colors are indifferent,
but it is very important that you make the box structure that we indicate.

The maximum width of the layer that will contain the entire layout has to be <i>1200px</i> (max-width:1200px).

Check the image below for a preview of the desired layout:
